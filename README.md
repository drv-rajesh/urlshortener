# urlshortener
A simple URL shortener in Python using the Bilty API. The amount of comments are attributed to me submitting this for an application, so do your best to ignore them.

Couple of things you need to keep in mind:
- You need a Bitly account to do this - register @ https://bitly.com/
- There is a limit of 1000 URLs/month unless you are a Pro User
- Your username is not your display name, it is your account name, found in account settings
- One URL per run to avoid rate limiting
